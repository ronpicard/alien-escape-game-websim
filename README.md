# Alien Escape - Built with WebSim and Prompt Programming

## Introduction

**WebSim** is a platform that lets you create fully functional web games using **natural language prompts** instead of traditional coding. It leverages modern large language models (LLMs) to translate your creative ideas into playable HTML/CSS/JavaScript games, exposing editable game variables for further tuning.

For this project, I explored multiple LLMs including:
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- ChatGPT 4.1
- Sonnet 3.7
- DeepSeek V3.1

## Project Overview: *Alien Escape*

**Alien Escape** is a vertical-scrolling game where you pilot an alien spaceship on a journey toward a black hole. The environment evolves as you ascend—from grassy landscapes to deep space—dodging obstacles like satellites, ships, and planets.

### Key Features:
- Smooth transitions between environment layers (Earth to space)
- Interactive hazards and obstacles
- Supports both desktop and mobile
- Configurable gameplay parameters (speed, spawn rates, etc.)
- Sound effects and UI buttons

### Development Highlights:
- Built using prompt programming via WebSim
- Initial prototype completed in ~3 hours
- Total development time: 20+ hours (mostly waiting on model regeneration)
- Hybrid workflow: prompt-driven code generation + manual debugging

## Lessons Learned

### Limitations of Prompt-Based Development
- **Context Limits**: LLMs struggle with large projects beyond ~3,000 LOC due to token constraints.
- **Workarounds**: Switched models, rewrote prompts, or manually revised code when logic broke down.
- **Best Practices**: Keep complexity low or modularize features to stay within token windows.

## The Future of Prompt Programming

WebSim hints at a future where **natural language becomes the primary interface for creation**—not just in games, but in broader software, world-building, and even physical construction via robotics and AI.

### Key Insights:
- Creative fluency may soon outweigh technical fluency
- Hybrid workflows (AI + human reasoning) are essential today
- Tomorrow's creators will shape reality by imagining it, not coding it line-by-line

## Final Thoughts

**Alien Escape** was a window into the evolving landscape of AI-assisted creation. The combination of prompt programming and LLMs like ChatGPT unlocks a new kind of workflow—faster, more intuitive, and deeply creative.
